https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/building-the-connection-url

The JDBC driver supports the use of Type 2 integrated authentication
on Windows operating systems by using the integratedSecurity
connection string property. To use integrated authentication,
copy the mssql-jdbc_auth-<version>-<arch>.dll file to a directory
on the Windows system path on the computer where the JDBC driver
is installed.
